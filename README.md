# CoreLocationMapkit

In this project I use CoreLocation and Mapkit to find location by coordinate, name, placemark, keyword in different types of maps.
Also implemented possible routes, directions, steps, expected time to travel, calculate speed distance from source to destination.
This project really helps me a lot to understand the power of CoreLocation and Mapkit. I think it'll help you too. I also use Apple Maps in my project.
Normally user can use all transport types except transit. If someone wants to use transport type as transit then they must take
help of apple maps to show direction. A big thanks to Steven Lipton üôèüèº. I use his tutorial on Mapkit.
